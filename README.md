What is DevOps

Why DevOps
- I have a passion for for collaboration and teamwork and what draws me to DevOps as a career is the impact it has on the business as a whole.

- Communication - in order to produce software and ensure quick releases whilst maintaining high quality, the team will need to communicate constantly with each other through each phase 
- Collaboration - the team need to work together to ensure that there is a better understanding of the target infrastructure and the changes that may be required and as well the preparation needed for the changes. They can use tools like SharePoint to do this.
- Automation - this is the key to a successful DevOps transformation. It can be used to bridge the gap between development and operation as well as solidifying the releases process. They can use tools like Puppet and Chef for automation.
- Monitoring - each memeber of the team is required to provide any cruicial information in order to measure the progress. Tools like ELK stack and Application insights can be used to monitor.


What is Cloud computing?
- An on-demand delivery of IT serivces over the internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Allows you to access technology services such as storage, databases on a needed basis from a cloud provider.

Benefits of Cloud computing?

- Location - allows you to expand to new regions and deploy in shorter time span. This will also allow better collaboration as others can access it from anywhere
- Scalability - Resources can be scaled quickly up to meet the business demand and vise versa

Why should we use it?
- It allows more flexibility and reliability and helps to decrease costs by elimanating the need to invest in physical infrastructure
- Allows access to various tools on an immediate demand

- Ease of adoption - they can access any tools by just purchasing a plan and this also saves money as it would eliminate the need for personnel to make sure the software/hardware configurations are functional.
